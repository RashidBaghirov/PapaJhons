                            There are several reasons why a promo code may not be valid: -
                            You have already used a one-time promo code sent to you; - The
                            period of the offer is over; - The promo code has not been
                            entered correctly. Make sure that you have carefully entered
                            the promo code sent to you, given uppercase and lowercase
                            letters. Make sure that you do not enter unnecessary
                            characters. Do not copy the promo code, but enter manually.

                        <p>
                            The sizes of pizzas on the traditional dough are 18 cm - 4
                            pieces, 23 cm - 6 pieces, 30 cm - 8 pieces, 35 cm - 10 pieces.
                            Sizes of pizzas on a thin dough of 23 cm - 6 pieces, 30 cm - 8
                            pieces, 35 cm - 10 pieces. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
                            TRADITIONAL DOUGH AND THIN? The traditional dough differs from
                            the thin on the edges of the pizza. The fine dough is mixed in
                            the same way as the traditional dough, but the process of its
                            preparation is using a different technology to achieve the
                            effect of a thin puff dough cracker. When ordering pizza on a
                            traditional dough, one garlic sauce is given as a free of
                            charge.

                        <p style="line-height: 10%"></p>

                        <p>
                            - When producing and handling of the dough due gluing of the
                            dough to gloves, latex gloves are not used in any country in
                            the world. Also, there is a possibility that when a glove
                            tears, its pieces can fall into the dough. Employees of the
                            company wash and disinfect hands every 30 minutes or in case
                            of leaving the workplace. Also, the employees' hands are
                            checked every morning before production on the presence of
                            cuts, abrasions and hygienic condition of the hands. - Gloves
                            are worn in the case of cuts and wounds in the producing of
                            dough and are used exceptionally of bright color to prevent
                            falling to the dough when producing.
